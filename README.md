# Python-APIs

# General Information
For the WeatherPy analysis, I am using the longitudes and latitudes of a random list of cities within a specific range to analyze the temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. After parsing the data from the API request, I created dataframes for plotting scatter plots and regression for analysis.

For the VacationPy analysis, I am using the latitudes and longitudes of a list of cities from a csv to display hvplots of cities and hotel locations on maps.
